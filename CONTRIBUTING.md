# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Requesting new features and taps
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rafifos/tap/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rafifos/tap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=); it's that easy!

## Request new features and taps using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rafifos/tap/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Request new features or taps by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rafifos/tap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
